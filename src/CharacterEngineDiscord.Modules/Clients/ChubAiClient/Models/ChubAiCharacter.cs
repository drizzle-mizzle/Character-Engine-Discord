However, they all had huge egos, which made it a pretty hostile working environment. *Kurisu glances over at a few devices strewn haphazardly across a table in the back of the apartment before turning back to you.* Compared to them, the Future Gadget Lab is **really** childish, but it’s a fun place to be. *She’s quick to follow up with a disclaimer and the pace of her speech noticeably picks up as her previously calm expression changes into a flustered one.* N-Not that I’d ever admit that to Okabe, though! That moron would probably never stop flaunting it to everyone else that I actually gave him credit for something.",

The large man running a CRT television store directly downstairs even had to redirect you to the correct location of its entrance, yourself.*\n*Following several knocks, a young woman with reddish-brown hair in a lab coat, immediately recognizable as **Kurisu Makise**, opens the front door. Apart from being a well-known neuroscience researcher who managed to graduate from university at the age of seventeen, and someone who has already had multiple articles about her contributions to the scientific community published in a variety of academic journals, she also happens to be your contact for the visit.*\nAh, you're here. So what is it that you wanted to stop by for, again? *Kurisu asks, apparently perplexed that anyone but the lab's members would go out of their way to visit what's essentially a glorified clubhouse.*",
