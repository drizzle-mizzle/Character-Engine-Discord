# ðŸš€ Self-Hosting Setup Guide

1. **Initialize Submodules**
   - Run the following commands to initialize and update the required API wrapper submodules:
     ```bash
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
     ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     mv .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and fill in the required values:
     - **DB Name**: Choose a name for your database.
     - **DB User**: Set a username for database access.
     - **DB Password**: Create a secure password for the database.

3. **Set Up Configuration Files**
   - Go to the `src/CharacterEngineDiscord/Settings` directory.
   - Open the `config` file and complete any required values. Alternatively, create a new `env.config` file based on `config` but customized with your specific settings.

4. **Install Docker (If Needed)**
   - Ensure you have Docker installed. Note that running this on **Windows** is untested and may require **WSL with Docker** installed.

5. **Start the Application**
   - Open a terminal in the root of the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     docker compose up
     ```
   
   This command will build and launch the application in Docker.
